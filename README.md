## AYBeat (AY-3-8910 PSG Music Player with VU Meter)

### Music Player Release
AYBeat is an Arduino-driven AY-3-8910 PSG music player that reads music files from an SD card and outputs audio via a phono jack. It has a stereo VU meter using LEDs, an OLED display for selecting tunes, and a 3-channel UV bar.
Developed with the Arduino IDE, prototyped on a breadboard, and finalized using EasyEDA. It plays PSG music from an SD card and includes a VU meter, OLED display, and button controls, blending retro sound with modern hardware.

_More features will be added to the software in the future. I have a spare button available for functions like settings - the overall hardware design should remain unchanged._

#### Hardware Used
- **Arduino Nano:** Microcontroller with 14 digital I/O pins, 8 analog inputs, and 16MHz clock. Drives the AY-3 sound chip via digital pins.
- **AY-3-8910 PSG:** Generates sound with three audio channels, supporting square wave, white noise, and tone generation.
- **OLED Display:** 32x128 resolution display connected via I2C.
- **SD Card Reader:** File storage, connected via SPI.
- **Buttons (x4):** Single pin input using a resistor ladder for multiple buttons/actions.
- **Audio Jack:** Outputs sound generated by the AY.

#### AY-3-8910 PSG Overview 
- Introduced in 1977, the AY-3 became a mainstay in early gaming
- Three independent audio channels
- Square wave, white noise, and tone generation
- Envelope generator for sound shaping
- Popular in systems like the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, MSX, and Atari ST.
