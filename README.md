## AY-3-8910 PSG Music Player with VU Meter

### Music Player Release
This version features a streamlined hardware design and an improved user interface.

Hardware Used
- **Arduino Nano:** Compact and affordable microcontroller with 14 digital I/O pins, 8 analog inputs, and 16 MHz clock. Drives the AY-3 sound chip via digital pins.
- **AY-3-8910 PSG:** Generates sound with three audio channels, supporting square wave, white noise, and tone generation.
- **OLED Display:** 32x128 resolution, energy-efficient, and high-contrast display connected via I2C.
- **SD Card Reader:** Enables file storage, connected via SPI.
- **Buttons (x4):** Single pin input using a resistor ladder for multiple actions.
- **Audio Jack:** Outputs sound generated by the AY.

#### AY-3-8910 PSG Overview
- Three independent audio channels
- Square wave, white noise, and tone generation
- Envelope generator for sound shaping
- Low-cost alternative to Yamaha YM2149F
- Popular in retro computers, consoles, and arcade games
Introduced in 1977, the AY-3-8910 became a mainstay in early gaming and computing for its affordability and versatile sound.
